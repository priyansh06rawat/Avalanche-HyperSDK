# Avalanche-HyperSDK
The HyperSDK provides the ability to create a custom virtual machine, which offers complete control over a custom blockchain. With the HyperSDK, you can design a blockchain that perfectly suits your needs, such as creating and transferring tokens or implementing a traditional order book for asset trading. This level of customization provides a powerful tool for businesses and organizations seeking a tailored solution.

By using the HyperSDK, you have full control over the rules and functionality of your chain, allowing you to create a custom blockchain that is tailored to your startup's specific needs. This offers an unparalleled level of control and flexibility, making it a valuable tool for organizations seeking a custom solution.

This level of control allows your startup to create a unique solution that meets the needs of your users and provides a competitive edge in the market.
Since HyperSDK is alpha software, we are using the example token VM, this is one of the few that has been tested and is guarantee to be maintained in the upcoming future.
